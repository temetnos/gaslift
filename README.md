# GasLift

## The Future of Gasless Transactions on Ethereum L2s

GasLift is a next-generation Account Abstraction infrastructure that eliminates gas fees for end-users, making blockchain applications as seamless as web2 experiences. Built specifically for Ethereum L2 ecosystems, GasLift enables dApps to sponsor transaction fees in a secure, scalable, and cost-effective manner.

## Vision

Mission is to onboard the next billion users to web3 by removing the complexities of blockchain transactions. GasLift envisions a future where:

- Users never need to think about gas fees or seed phrases
- dApps can abstract away blockchain complexities
- Developers can focus on building great products instead of wallet integrations
- Gas sponsorship becomes a standard growth tool for web3 applications

##  Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **UniversalPaymaster (Smart Contracts)**
   - ERC-4337 compliant Paymaster contracts
   - Multi-token support with Chainlink price feeds
   - Gasless transaction verification and execution
   - Secure deposit/withdrawal mechanisms

2. **Bundler Service**
   - High-performance TypeScript implementation
   - Redis-backed mempool for operation batching
   - Multi-chain operation support
   - Automatic gas price optimization

3. **Gateway API**
   - RESTful and JSON-RPC endpoints
   - Rate limiting and API key management
   - Real-time operation status tracking
   - Webhook notifications

4. **SDK**
   - TypeScript-first developer experience
   - React hooks for frontend integration
   - Server-side utilities for backend services
   - Comprehensive type safety

### For dApp Developers
- **Seamless Integration**: Add gasless transactions with <15 LOC
- **Multi-Chain Ready**: Deploy once, run on any EVM-compatible chain
- **Cost-Effective**: Optimized gas usage saves on transaction costs
- **Enterprise Grade**: Built with security and scalability in mind

### For End Users
- **No More Gas Fees**: Interact with dApps without holding native tokens
- **One-Click Transactions**: Simple, web2-like experience
- **Secure**: Non-custodial design ensures asset safety
- **Cross-Chain**: Unified experience across multiple L2s
